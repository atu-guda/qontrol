Subschemes.
Check: update link values only after step - prep for multi-threading
New buttons for ObjDataWidget: need better (simple) labels.
Show output number in hint (this done, but may be in name too?).
Indicate corresponding outs for selected plot
Customized colors: struct view...
Copy/paste plots, outs.
Common selection elems/outs/plots?
Inputs - may be Elements? like TFileSource?
Dump TOutArr/TGraph commandline (-p/-P)
Check/use model run status (in batch, for tests)
Excess? error in fromDom ... and/or show last error?
More functional labels in dialogs: go to buddy, autoset ....
Outputs - or even IO - for external data.
Tests
Autocorrelation?
Run script before/after run (+ file)
Shadow model while run?

Propagate modified flag up to root?
Application config: to TDataSet?

JS run dialog. + one-line above log viewer
Set more data while object creation

Sub simulation? / set of dialog-ed values before run
Add to model object: common parameters. Is really need? Use params in model/scheme/simulation
Add to model object: functions? but what?

Call parent post_set (if req). flag?
Input/output elements/scheme properties (in0?)
unify add/paste elem: param in dialog?
unify add param/object : add_obj_param? + dialog
RunWindow?
Edit large arrays
More data/controls: Font, Date, Time

Hide startLoop - like fun,f
Auto create GET/SET function for my datas, create Qt properties - scripts. ? FAIL?
order -> only hint?
js/large text edit widget + button/dialog + external editor (partial done)?


objects: TFileInput, TFileOutput, TSoundInput, -- or IO in model
  TMovingAver, TDiff
  -- TDefuzzy, TQuality (TCriterion is busy/TCrit)
  -- Rastrigin and more
  -- or File Source input/output
may be new field in TClassInfo to misc flags: can f() w/o preRun..., 
    class group.. etc
implement loading objects in so.

Distributions analysis + plot
vector icons (language=SVG?) (may be dynamic)
Hue of elements
Label of element (or/and floating labels on structure view)
Labels on plot view (fixed, attached to some points)
Report with macros -- overrided by scripts?
